# Retail Store_Management_System

1. Data Prep: I start by collecting data and taking a first look to understand its structure.
2. Model Building: Based on the data and project needs, I create a custom model to organize it.
3. ETL: Using SSIS to move data from Excel files to your SQL Server database.
4. Dimensional Tables: I create separate tables for descriptive details and numerical measurements, then merge the data.
5. Data Views: I craft specific views of the data for easier analysis and visualization.
6. Tableau Exploration: Finally, I use Tableau to explore the data and create visualizations to uncover deeper meaning.
